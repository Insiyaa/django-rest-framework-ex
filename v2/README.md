# v2

Improved the simple Django RESTful Web Service.

Took advantage of model serializers. Then, understood the different accepted and returned content types and the importance of providing accurate responses to the HTTP OPTIONS requests.

Incorporated the @api_view decorator and made the necessary changes to the existing code to enable diverse parsers and renderers.Worked with different content types and noticed the improvement of the RESTful Web Service compared with its previous versions.
