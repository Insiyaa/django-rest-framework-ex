# v1

First version of a simple Django RESTful Web Service that interacts with an SQLite database

API views to process diverse HTTP requests on a collection of toys and on a specific toy. Worked with the following HTTP verbs: GET, POST, and PUT. Configured the URL patterns list to route URLs to views.

Started the Django development server and used command-line tools (curl and HTTPie) to compose and send diverse HTTP requests to RESTful Web Service. Learned how HTTP requests were processed in Django.
